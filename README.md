This is my Team Profile Generator.  It generates a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so I can quickly access the emails and GitHub profiles of all the individuals of the team.
The application is built using Node Javascript, Jest for running the unit testing and Inquirer for collecting user input. 
By typing "node index.js", the application will start from the command line and continuing until the end, 
where it is designed to open an internet webpage containing your selections of your team.  
Below is a link to a video of myself explaining specifics of the application and its functionality.
